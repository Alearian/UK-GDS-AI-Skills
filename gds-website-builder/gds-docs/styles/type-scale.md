#  Type scale 
GOV.UK Frontend v6.0.0 and later includes an updated the type scale to increase the size of text on small screens, improving legibility and accessibility.
[See an overview of the changes to the type scale](./get-started/new-type-scale.md).
The type scale is a collection of font sizes and line heights that underpin all of the typographic styles on GOV.UK. It has been [tested and iterated](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/12/12/making-the-gov-uk-frontend-typography-scale-more-accessible/) for readability on different devices.
When creating new components, always start by using the existing typography styles. If you need to create a new style, align it with one of the points on the type scale.
## How it works
Like the [spacing scale](./styles/spacing.md), every point on the type scale uses a line height in a multiple of 5px. This creates a consistent vertical rhythm, which makes pages easier to scan and read.
GOV.UK Frontend outputs CSS in relative units like `em` or `rem`. This helps the type resize better when zoomed or magnified. We’ve used pixels (px) here so it’s easier to understand.
## Responsive behaviour
The type scale changes based on screen size.
The scale for ‘large screens’ is used when the screen is wider than the tablet breakpoint (640px).  
Large screens  
| Point on type scale  | Used by  | Font size  | Line height  |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| 80  | Only used in exceptional circumstances  | 80px  | 80px  |  
| 48  | `govuk-heading-xl`  | 48px  | 50px  |  
| 36  | `govuk-heading-l`  | 36px  | 40px  |  
| 27  | Only used in exceptional circumstances  | 27px  | 30px  |  
| 24  |  `govuk-heading-m`, `govuk-body-l`  | 24px  | 30px  |  
| 19  |  `govuk-heading-s`, `govuk-body`  | 19px  | 25px  |  
| 16  | `govuk-body-s`  | 16px  | 20px  |  
Small screens  
| Point on type scale  | Used by  | Font size  | Line height  |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| 80  | Only used in exceptional circumstances  | 53px  | 55px  |  
| 48  | `govuk-heading-xl`  | 32px  | 35px  |  
| 36  | `govuk-heading-l`  | 27px  | 30px  |  
| 27  | Only used in exceptional circumstances  | 21px  | 25px  |  
| 24  |  `govuk-heading-m`, `govuk-body-l`  | 21px  | 25px  |  
| 19  |  `govuk-heading-s`, `govuk-body`  | 19px  | 25px  |  
| 16  | `govuk-body-s`  | 16px  | 20px  |  
## Using the type scale in your own CSS
Include the [`govuk-font` mixin](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-font) to use GOV.UK typography in your CSS.
For example, if you want a custom element to use type scale point 19, use:

```
@include govuk-font($size: 19);
```

You can add additional arguments to control font weight, use tabular font spacing, or to override the line height:

```
@include govuk-font($size: 19, $weight: bold, $tabular: true);
```

### If you only want to set the font size
Do not use `govuk-font` if you only want to change the font size and line height as it includes additional typography-related CSS like the New Transport font family. Instead, you should use the [`govuk-font-size` mixin](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-font-size):

```
@include govuk-font-size($size: 19);
```
